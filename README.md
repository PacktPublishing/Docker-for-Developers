Docker is the de-facto standard for containerizing applications. It allows developers to run the same software on their workstations in the same way it will run on a cluster of servers in production, while simplifying many configuration and deployment issues. 

With an increasing number of software projects migrating to containers, to reduce cost, complexity and improve portability it is crucial for engineering and DevOps teams to understand how to build and deploy secure Docker environments.

If you are new to container-based development, this book walks you through three keys areas, how to build containers and develop software using the containers, how to deploy them in Cloud environments, and how to ensure they are secure. 

This book provides a synthesis of three important areas of Docker based development (creation, deployment and securing containers) through a hands-on approach. The book can be read cover to cover or dived into by section, for those looking for help with a specific topic. 

You’ll learn how containers works and how to create and development projects within them. Following this you will learn how to deploy them to the cloud using DevOps techniques and ensure that security is taken into consideration from start to finish. 

By the end of this book you will understand how containers work, how to develop within them, how to deploy Docker containers to a variety of environments, including both a local learning environment and a Cloud Native Kubernetes cluster using the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and you will learn security best practices along the way.

Regardless of whether you are a DevOps engineer, a Software Engineering lead, or a software developer looking for ways to create a sane environment, learning how to build and deploy applications in Docker will make you a stronger practitioner!
