# docker-compose.yml
# 
# Docker for Developers - Chapter 5 docker-compose.yml - ShipIt Clicker
#
# Adapted from the barebones example in the Docker documentation
#     https://docs.docker.com/compose/
#
# This is in a state that a developer might reasonably have as they
# approach their first production deployment - this is a starting
# point. 
#
# See [Chapter 6](../chapter6/) for a more robust example of
# docker-compose.yml and related configuration files.
# 
# You would probably be better off basing real work on the files there.
